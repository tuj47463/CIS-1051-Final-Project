# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Better Not To oPEN THE DooR

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A door entry alarm sensor that beeps and sends warning email.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

When the door is opened, the device makes alert sound / turns the LED light on the device to red / sends an email.
And when the device is removed, the device completes the same task above but differnt alert sound / LED to Blue / sends an email with different messages on it.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NONE

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NONE

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The device detects the entry and beeps.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making two differnt types of alert sound. One for the entry and the other for the action of removing the device.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Sending an email with using Python.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Better understanding on while loop and dictionaries. Being more comfortable with using function on Python. Need to find out how to send an email with Python (thinking of using import statement). Lastly, I need to take advantage of the sensors on the coding robot(device).
